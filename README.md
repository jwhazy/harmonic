# harmonic v2

Music bot in TypeScript. Extremely basic. Uses discord.js.

## Known issues

- Age/country specific videos crash the bot (or aren't discoverable when searching). **Update:** This has been fixed if you add cookies to your enviroment variables - see .env.example
- YouTube only, support for Spotify is limited (may change later).
- Crashes everywhere. Report them in the Issues tab, with back-trace if possible thanks.

## Get started

Add related enviroment variables in .env (see .env.example). Install packages with `pnpm install` and run the server with `pnpm run start`
