# harmonic - frontend

Music bot in TypeScript. Extremely basic. Uses discord.js, ffmpeg and play-dl. This branch has the frontend and API in it.

**This bot is designed for private & single server use only, it will not work over multiple servers.**

**Please only use this bot if you have experience in JavaScript/Node.js software. Providing help for Node rookies is beyond the scope of this project, sorry.**

## Known issues

- Age/country specific videos crash the bot (or aren't discoverable when searching).
- YouTube only (may change later).
- Crashes everywhere. Report them in the Issues tab, with back-trace if possible thanks.
- UI is basic and doesn't do much currently.
- API is not fully password protected (or even finished for that matter). Avoid using it.

## Get started
